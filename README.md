# Seismograph
This app is a personal seismograph. It visualizes the accelerometer data that your device is receiving and illustrates the X, Y and Z readings in a smooth scrolling display. This turns out to be a handy tool for checking the amount of vibration that the device is receiving. You can then save a snapshot in a png image or the entire history in XML so you can process the data later.
